### 🧠 Quick Intro

Hey, I’m Vivek — a CS undergrad who prefers GitHub over group projects.  
I work at the intersection of **ML and Full-Stack Engineering**, shipping things that aren’t just “cool” — they actually work.  
Currently experimenting with real-world ML deployments, scalable backends, and tight UI loops.

### 🔨 What I Code With (and Love)

#### 🚧 Languages & Scripts I Use Like Tools
`Python` · `JavaScript` · `C++` · `Java` · `C`  
Ask me about REST APIs, async bugs, or vectorized ops — I’ve got war stories.

#### 🧠 ML Playground
`PyTorch` · `TensorFlow` · `Scikit-learn` · `OpenCV` · `Pandas`  
Latest obsessions: CNN quantization, real-time video inference, and LLM fine-tuning.

#### 🌐 Full-Stack Power Moves
`React.js` · `Node.js` · `Express` · `MySQL` · `HTML/CSS`  
Working on making my backends fast and my frontends tolerable.

#### 🛠 Infra, Cloud & DevOps
`Docker` · `AWS` · `Linux` · `Git`  
I containerize everything. Even weekend projects.

### 📌 Pinned Side Quests

- 🔍 **Realtime Fire Detection with YOLOv5**  
  Fine-tuned and deployed to run on CCTV feeds with 93% precision  
  *(Yes, it triggers alerts IRL)*

- 🎮 **Multiplayer JS Game Engine**  
  WebSocket-powered, server-state synced game logic  
  Learned more debugging than building this

- 🧾 **AutoML Pipeline with GUI**  
  Made for non-coders: feed CSV → get trained models + eval reports  
  Because Kaggle notebooks aren't the endgame

### 🤝 I’m Open To

- Internships: backend-heavy, ML-driven, or full-stack firestarters  
- Collabs: Let’s ship fast, learn faster  
- Nerd-outs: Model performance chats, infra scaling, or even just dark mode debates
