### 🧠 Quick Intro

Hey, I’m Vivek — a CS undergrad who prefers GitHub over group projects.  
I work at the intersection of **ML and Full-Stack Engineering**, shipping things that aren’t just “cool” — they actually work.  
Currently experimenting with real-world ML deployments, scalable backends, and tight UI loops.
